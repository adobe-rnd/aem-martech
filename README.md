## How It Works

This plugin optimizes the integration of Adobe's marketing technology stack by moving away from a monolithic Adobe Launch script. Instead, it "decomposes" the key components‚ÄîAdobe Experience Platform WebSDK and Adobe Client Data Layer (ACDL)‚Äîand loads them at the optimal time during the page load lifecycle.

This is achieved through a phased approach that aligns with modern web performance best practices:

- **Eager Phase**: Handles critical tasks like personalization during the initial page load to prevent content flicker, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Lazy Phase**: Loads analytics and the data layer after the main content has rendered, capturing metrics without delaying the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).
- **Delayed Phase**: Executes non-essential scripts, like third-party tags via Launch, after the page is fully interactive.

By instrumenting the core Adobe libraries directly but in a controlled sequence, this plugin minimizes performance impact while retaining the full power of the Adobe Experience Cloud.

## Features

The AEM MarTech plugin is essentially a wrapper around the Adobe Experience Platform WebSDK and the Adobe Client Data Layer that seamlessly integrates your website with:

- üéØ Adobe Target or Adobe Journey Optimizer: to personalize your pages
- üìä Adobe Analytics: to track customer journey data
- üö© Adobe Experience Platform Tags (a.k.a. Launch): to track your custom events

Its key differentiators are:
- üåç **Experience Platform enabled**: The library fully integrates with our main Adobe Experience Platform and all the services of our ecosystem.
- üöÄ **Extremely fast**: The library is optimized to reduce load delay, TBT, and CLS, and has a minimal impact on your Core Web Vitals.
- üë§ **Privacy-first**: The library does not track end-users by default and can be easily integrated with your preferred consent management system.
- üî¨ **Speculative prerender aware**: The library supports [speculative prerendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) and won't fire Analytics events (and artificially inflate your page views) until the page is actually viewed.

## Prerequisites

You need access to:
- **Adobe Experience Platform** (no full license needed, just basic permissions for data collection)
- **Adobe Analytics**
- **Adobe Target** or **Adobe Journey Optimizer**

### Launch Container Configuration

:warning: **CRITICAL SETUP STEP**

Before instrumenting your project, you must configure your Adobe Experience Platform Tags (Launch) container correctly for use with this plugin.

- **DO NOT** include the following extensions in your Launch container:
    - `Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK`
    - `Adobe Analytics`
    - `Adobe Target`

This plugin handles the initialization of these components directly to optimize performance. Including them in Launch will lead to conflicts and potential data duplication.

- **DO** ensure you have the `Adobe Client Data Layer` extension configured.

:warning: **Legal Disclaimer:** This library defaults user consent to `pending` to comply with privacy regulations. Overriding this behavior to grant consent by default (e.g., setting it to `in`) without explicit user agreement may have significant legal implications under regulations like GDPR and CCPA. We strongly advise consulting with your legal team before altering the default consent handling.

We also recommend using a proper consent management system.

## Installation

We have a comprehensive [tutorial on Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/platform-learn/tutorial-one-adobe/assetmgmt/assetm1/ex6), or you can just follow the steps below.

Add the plugin to your AEM project by running:
```sh
git subtree add --squash --prefix plugins/martech git@github.com:adobe-rnd/aem-martech.git main
```

If you later want to pull the latest changes and update your local copy of the plugin:
```sh
git subtree pull --squash --prefix plugins/martech git@github.com:adobe-rnd/aem-martech.git main
```

If the `subtree pull` command fails, you can delete the `plugins/martech` folder and re-add it using the `git subtree add` command.

If you use a linter, make sure to ignore minified files in your `.eslintignore`:
```
*.min.js
```

## Project Instrumentation

To connect and configure the plugin, you'll need to edit your project's `head.html` and `scripts.js`.

### 1. Add Preload Hints

Add the following lines at the end of your `head.html` to speed up page load:
```html
<link rel="preload" as="script" crossorigin="anonymous" href="/plugins/martech/src/index.js"/>
<link rel="preload" as="script" crossorigin="anonymous" href="/plugins/martech/src/alloy.min.js"/>
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://edge.adobedc.net"/>
<!-- Change to adobedc.demdex.net if you enable third-party cookies -->
```

### 2. Import Plugin Methods

Import the necessary methods at the top of your `scripts.js` file:
```js
import {
  initMartech,
  updateUserConsent,
  martechEager,
  martechLazy,
  martechDelayed,
} from '../plugins/martech/src/index.js';
```

### 3. Configure the Plugin

Call `initMartech` at the top of the `loadEager` method in your `scripts.js`. This function takes two arguments: the WebSDK configuration and the library-specific configuration.

```js
/**
 * Loads everything needed to get to LCP.
 */
async function loadEager(doc) {
  // Hook in your consent check to determine if personalization can run.
  const isConsentGiven = true; /* your consent logic here */

  const martechLoadedPromise = initMartech(
    // 1. WebSDK Configuration
    // Docs: https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/commands/configure/overview#configure-js
    {
      datastreamId: /* your datastream id here */,
      orgId: /* your IMS org id here */,
      // The `debugEnabled` flag is automatically set to true on localhost and .page URLs.
      // The `defaultConsent` is automatically set to "pending".
      onBeforeEventSend: (payload) => {
        // This callback allows you to modify the payload before it's sent.
        // Return false to prevent the event from being sent.
      },
      edgeConfigOverrides: {
        // Optional datastream overrides for different environments.
      },
    },
    // 2. Library Configuration
    {
      personalization: !!getMetadata('target') && isConsentGiven,
      launchUrls: [/* your Launch script URLs here */],
      // See the API Reference for all available options.
    },
  );
  // ... rest of loadEager
}
```

### 4. Wait for Personalization

Adjust your `loadEager` method to wait for the MarTech promise to resolve before rendering the main content. This prevents content flicker from personalized content.

```js
// ... inside loadEager
if (main) {
  decorateMain(main);
  document.body.classList.add('appear');
  await Promise.all([
    martechLoadedPromise.then(martechEager),
    loadSection(main.querySelector('.section'), waitForFirstImage),
  ]);
}
```

### 5. Load Lazy Logic

Add a reference to `martechLazy` just after the `loadFooter(‚Ä¶);` call in your `loadLazy` method:
```js
async function loadLazy(doc) {
  // ...
  loadFooter(doc.querySelector('footer'));
  await martechLazy();
  // ...
}
```

### 6. Load Delayed Logic

Add a reference to `martechDelayed` in your `loadDelayed` method:
```js
function loadDelayed() {
  window.setTimeout(() => {
    martechDelayed();
    import('./delayed.js');
  }, 3000);
}
```

## API Reference

The plugin exports several functions to interact with the marketing stack.

---

### `initMartech(webSDKConfig, martechConfig)`
Initializes the library. This should be called once in `loadEager`.

- **`webSDKConfig`** `{Object}`: Configuration for the Adobe Experience Platform WebSDK. Requires `datastreamId` and `orgId`.
- **`martechConfig`** `{Object}`: Optional configuration for this library.

## Consent Management

Connect your consent management system (CMS) to track user consent. Call `updateUserConsent` when your CMS sends a consent event.

#### Integrating with AEM Consent Banner Block
Example for the [AEM Consent Banner Block](https://github.com/adobe/aem-block-collection/pull/50):
```js
function consentEventHandler(ev) {
  const collect = ev.detail.categories.includes('CC_ANALYTICS');
  const marketing = ev.detail.categories.includes('CC_MARKETING');
  const personalize = ev.detail.categories.includes('CC_TARGETING');
  const share = ev.detail.categories.includes('CC_SHARING');
  updateUserConsent({ collect, marketing, personalize, share });
}
window.addEventListener('consent', consentEventHandler);
window.addEventListener('consent-updated', consentEventHandler);
```

#### Integrating with OneTrust
Example for [OneTrust](https://www.onetrust.com):
```js
function consentEventHandler(ev) {
 const groups = ev.detail;
 const collect = groups.includes('C0002'); // Performance Cookies
 const personalize = groups.includes('C0003'); // Functional Cookies
 const share = groups.includes('C0008'); // Targeted Advertising
 updateUserConsent({ collect, personalize, share });
}
window.addEventListener('consent.onetrust', consentEventHandler);
```

## Working with Dynamic Content (SPAs)

For Single Page Applications or pages with dynamic content, you may need to manage personalization manually to avoid concurrency issues.

1.  **Follow the SPA approach** and define [views in Adobe Target](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/target/using/experiences/spa-visual-experience-composer).
2.  **Import the helper methods** in your components:
    ```js
    import {
      isPersonalizationEnabled,
      getPersonalizationForView,
      applyPersonalization,
    } from '../plugins/martech/src/index.js';
    ```
3.  **Fetch the personalization** for the view when it renders:
    ```js
    if (isPersonalizationEnabled()) {
      await getPersonalizationForView('my-view-name');
    }
    ```
4.  **Apply the personalization** every time there is a significant DOM update:
    ```js
    applyPersonalization('my-view-name');
    ```

## FAQ

### Why not use the default Adobe Launch approach?
A default Launch implementation can negatively impact Core Web Vitals. Our approach optimizes for performance by loading components intelligently.

### Can't I just defer the Launch script?
Deferring the entire script introduces content flickering for personalization use cases and can lead to missed analytics events from users who bounce early.

### Why is `git subtree` used for installation?
`git subtree` is used to vendor the plugin's code directly into your project. This approach avoids the need for a package manager like `npm` and the complexities of `git submodule`, providing a simple way to pull in updates while keeping the code self-contained within your repository.

### What guarantees do I have that this won't break?
This library uses the same official Adobe Experience Platform WebSDK and Adobe Client Data Layer as Launch. We are building on documented Adobe APIs, such as [top and bottom of page events](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/use-cases/top-bottom-page-events), to ensure compatibility.

### What's the catch?
Since some logic is moved from the Launch UI into your project's code, not all features can be managed from the Launch UI. We recommend a baseline of the Core, ACDL, and AA via AEP Web SDK extensions in your Launch container.

## Dependencies

This plugin includes the following core libraries:
- **Adobe Experience Platform WebSDK**: `v2.27.0` (`alloy.min.js`)
- **Adobe Client Data Layer**: `v2.0.2` (`acdl.min.js`)

## Web SDK Configuration

This project manages the on-page, self-hosted implementation of the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK (`alloy.js`). When used with the **AEP Web SDK** extension in Adobe Launch, you must enable a specific setting to avoid conflicts and ensure optimal performance.

### Integration with Adobe Launch

In the AEP Web SDK extension settings within Adobe Launch, enable the **"Use existing alloy.js instance"** option.

When this is checked:
1.  The extension **will not** bundle a second copy of `alloy.js` into the Launch library.
2.  The extension **will not** re-configure the SDK. It will use the instance that has already been configured on the page by this project.
3.  All configuration settings within the Launch UI (e.g., Datastream ID, Org ID, Default Consent) will be ignored at runtime.

All SDK configuration must be handled within the scripts managed by this project.

### Configuration Reference

All configuration is set within the `alloy("configure", { ... })` command. For a complete and official reference of all available options, please see the Adobe Experience League documentation, which is the source of truth.

*   **Primary Documentation: [Configuring the Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/commands/configure/index.html)**

The table below summarizes the most common settings that are now managed here instead of in the Launch UI, with direct links to their respective documentation pages.

| Option | Description | Example Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [`datastreamId`](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/commands/configure/datastreamid) | The ID of the datastream to send data to. | `'YOUR_DATASTREAM_ID'` |
| [`orgId`](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/commands/configure/orgid) | Your Experience Cloud Organization ID. | `'YOUR_ORG_ID@AdobeOrg'` |
| [`edgeDomain`](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/commands/configure/edgedomain) | The first-party domain (CNAME) for interacting with Adobe services. | `'edge.your-domain.com'` |
| [`defaultConsent`](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/commands/configure/defaultconsent) | The default consent level (`in`, `out`, or `pending`). | `'pending'` |
| [`idMigrationEnabled`](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/commands/configure/idmigrationenabled) | Enables migration of visitor IDs from legacy Adobe libraries. | `true` |
| [`targetMigrationEnabled`](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/identity/id-migration/target-visitor-id) | Ensures visitor profile is maintained when migrating from `at.js`. | `true` |
| [`onBeforeEventSend`](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/commands/configure/onbeforeeventsend) | A callback function to modify event data before it's sent. | `(options) => { /* logic */ }` |

### Example On-Page Configuration

Here is an example of how you might configure the SDK in your script:

```javascript
alloy("configure", {
  // --- Required ---
  datastreamId: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  orgId: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@AdobeOrg",

  // --- Recommended ---
  edgeDomain: "edge.your-site.com",
  defaultConsent: "pending",

  // --- Optional: Migration & Callbacks ---
  idMigrationEnabled: true,
  targetMigrationEnabled: true,
  onBeforeEventSend: function(options) {
    // This callback allows for last-minute modification
    // of the XDM payload before it is sent.
    // For example, adding a custom context:
    options.xdm.customContext = "some value";
  }
});
```
